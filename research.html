NeuroScope is designed not just as a device, but as a platform for discovery, enabling researchers to collect, analyze, and interpret neural data in real time — wherever their studies take them. NeuroScope integrates state-of-the-art neurophysiological signal acquisition with embedded AI algorithms trained on large datasets to ensure accurate, reliable, and meaningful brainwave analysis. Its multi-channel system captures complex neural oscillations critical for understanding cognition, behavior, and neurological health. Our technology supports a wide range of research fields including: Neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders — aiding studies in epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s and more by developing AI powered diagnosis devices. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) — accelerating the development of thought-controlled devices and assistive technologies Mental health and stress research — quantifying biomarkers of anxiety, depression, and stress Sleep studies — enabling portable, long-term monitoring of sleep architecture and disorders We actively collaborate with academic institutions, healthcare organizations, and industry partners to expand NeuroScope’s applications and impact. Researchers using NeuroScope benefit from: Access to raw and processed EEG data streams Support for custom AI model integration and algorithm development Opportunities to co-publish findings and contribute to open datasets Dedicated technical support and training We invite researchers worldwide to explore how NeuroScope can transform their projects. Whether you are conducting lab-based experiments or field studies, our technology offers unmatched flexibility and insight.
